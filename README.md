# Eridian To English Translator

In Andy Weirs 'Project Hail Mary', Grace hacks together an eridian (music chord language) to english translator by using a freqency analysis program on a laptop taped to another laptop running excel. 

I got [nerdsniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by the program being described as being "barely even a programâ€”more of a script", so this is my attempt to capture the waveform of the bits of eridian the audiobook gives us and spit out a corresponding english translation. 

Grace says that he is "not a computer expert, but [he knows] some rudimentary programming" and that it only took him an hour. Only an hour, I wish! Most of the difficulty came from me doing the waveform analysis myself. Maybe it would have gone quicker if I had been less afraid to look into analysis software like https://friture.org/

DOESN'T YET WORK LOL, just spits out the notes of the loudest freqencies in each sample it takes 

```
python -m venv env
./env/scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
